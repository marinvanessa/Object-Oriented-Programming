# LanParty

The Faculty of Automation and Computers through LSAC organizes a LAN Party every semester attended by all students who want to test their skills at a certain game.
It is desired to create a software solution (executable program) that can automate this process.

## NOTE: ##

The implementation was done using STL(Standard Template Library).
